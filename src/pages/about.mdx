I'm a web app designer and developer working at the Innovation Lab at ADP who genuinely enjoys bringing value where ever he can. I have been working on the web since 1998 and proudly worked as a technician for [Safe Haven Computers](https://www.safehavenpc.com/) for many years before going into web app development full time.

You can find me [on Twitter](https://www.instagram.com/frankstallone/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/frankstallone/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iamfrankstallone/) where I share what I know and love.
